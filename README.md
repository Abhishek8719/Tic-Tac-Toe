# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The game automatically detects a winner or a draw, and provides a button to reset and play again. The code is organized with a main Board component and a Square component for each cell.
